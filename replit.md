# MemoryOS MCP Server

## Overview

MemoryOS is a Memory Operating System designed for personalized AI agents that provides persistent memory capabilities across multiple time horizons. It implements a three-tier memory architecture (short-term, mid-term, and long-term) with intelligent consolidation and retrieval mechanisms. The system is exposed as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server optimized for Gemini client integration while maintaining OpenAI embedding consistency.

## System Architecture

The system follows a modular, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Memory Architecture
- **Three-tier memory system**: Short-term (immediate conversations), mid-term (consolidated segments), and long-term (persistent knowledge and user profiles)
- **Heat-based consolidation**: Automatic promotion of frequently accessed information from mid-term to long-term memory
- **Semantic retrieval**: Uses OpenAI embeddings with FAISS-GPU support for efficient similarity search

### Component Structure
- **Core Memory Classes**: Each memory tier has its own dedicated class with specific storage and retrieval logic
- **Orchestration Layer**: Main `Memoryos` class coordinates all memory operations
- **MCP Interface**: Pure MCP 2.0 JSON-RPC implementation provides standards-compliant tool interface for external clients
- **Utility Layer**: Shared utilities for file operations, similarity computation, and data validation

## Key Components

### Memory Layers
1. **Short-term Memory** (`short_term.py`): Stores recent Q&A pairs with configurable capacity (default: 10 entries)
2. **Mid-term Memory** (`mid_term.py`): Maintains consolidated conversation segments with heat tracking (default: 2000 entries)
3. **Long-term Memory** (`long_term.py`): Persistent user profiles and knowledge bases with embedding-based retrieval

### Core Services
- **Memory Retriever** (`retriever.py`): Handles cross-layer memory retrieval with relevance scoring
- **Memory Updater** (`updater.py`): Manages consolidation and promotion between memory tiers
- **MCP Server** (`mcp_server.py`): Provides standardized tool interface using pure MCP 2.0 JSON-RPC implementation

### Storage Strategy
- **JSON files**: Human-readable storage for memory entries and metadata
- **NumPy arrays**: Efficient embedding storage with `.npy` format
- **User-specific directories**: Isolated data storage per user with configurable base path

## Data Flow

1. **Memory Addition**: New interactions enter short-term memory and trigger overflow processing when capacity is exceeded
2. **Consolidation**: Overflow entries are consolidated into mid-term memory segments using LLM-based summarization
3. **Promotion**: High-heat mid-term segments are promoted to long-term knowledge bases
4. **Retrieval**: Query embeddings are compared against all memory tiers to find relevant context
5. **Response Generation**: Retrieved context is used to generate personalized responses

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **OpenAI API**: Text generation (GPT-4o-mini) and embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
- **FastAPI**: Web framework for HTTP server and API endpoints
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and JSON-RPC request/response models

### Optional Enhancements
- **FAISS-GPU**: Hardware-accelerated similarity search for large embedding collections
- **Custom OpenAI endpoints**: Support for alternative API providers through configurable base URLs

### Python Libraries
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and embedding storage
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and structured returns
- **Standard library**: JSON, datetime, pathlib for core operations

## Deployment Strategy

### Configuration Management
- **JSON-based config**: Single `config.json` file with all system parameters
- **Environment variables**: API key injection for secure credential management
- **User isolation**: Per-user data directories with configurable storage paths

### MCP Integration
- **HTTP transport**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP for remote client communication
- **Bearer authentication**: Secure API key-based client authentication
- **Structured returns**: Pydantic models ensure consistent tool response formats
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error catching with user-friendly messages

### Scalability Considerations
- **Capacity limits**: Configurable memory limits prevent unbounded growth
- **Embedding caching**: Persistent storage of embeddings to avoid recomputation
- **Heat-based cleanup**: Automatic consolidation reduces memory footprint over time

## Recent Changes

✅ **July 08, 2025 - Redis-Style Short-Term Memory Implementation Fixed**
- **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE FIX**: Implemented correct Redis-style short-term memory following original BAI-LAB MemoryOS specification
- **Problem**: Short-term memory was using complex similarity filtering (0.7 threshold) causing empty retrieval results
- **Solution**: Replaced semantic filtering with true Redis-style FIFO fast access
- **Changes Applied**:
  - Removed similarity threshold filtering from `_get_short_term_context()` in retriever.py
  - Updated `get_context_for_query()` to use simple recent memory access instead of complex scoring
  - Changed short-term capacity from 10 to 7 entries (matching original MemoryOS spec)
  - Maintained scoring for compatibility but removed filtering exclusions
- **Redis-Style Features Implemented**:
  - Fast O(1) retrieval using deque-based storage
  - FIFO access pattern for recent conversation context
  - No computational overhead from embedding calculations
  - Sub-millisecond response times for short-term memory
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: 
  - Memory storage and retrieval both functional
  - Short-term memory returns recent entries regardless of semantic relevance
  - Queries about unrelated topics still return recent conversation context
  - True Redis-style behavior: fast access without filtering delays
- **Architecture Now Matches Original**: Short-term = fast FIFO, Mid-term = heat-based, Long-term = semantic search

- **Solution**: Implemented Redis-style in-memory storage using Python deque with automatic FIFO eviction
- **Redis-Style Performance Features**:
  - Fast O(1) insertion and retrieval using collections.deque
  - Automatic capacity management with maxlen parameter
  - FIFO eviction when capacity exceeded (oldest entries moved to overflow)
  - Simple JSON persistence only for recovery, not primary storage
  - Sub-millisecond access for recent conversations
- **Proper Memory Tier Separation**:
  - Short-term: Redis-style deque (fast, temporary, FIFO)
  - Mid-term: JSON + embeddings (indexed, heat-based promotion)
  - Long-term: JSON + embeddings (persistent, semantic search)
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: All FIFO operations, overflow handling, and persistence functional

- **Architecture Clarification**:
  - Short-term memory: Redis-style FIFO access without similarity filtering
  - Mid-term memory: Heat-based promotion with embedding similarity search  
  - Long-term knowledge: Semantic search with vector embeddings and relevance thresholds
- **VERIFIED WORKING**: 
  - Short-term: Fast FIFO retrieval provides recent conversation context
  - Mid-term: Similarity search with proper thresholds for consolidated segments
  - Long-term: Vector search with high relevance filtering for knowledge retrieval
- **Behavior**: Each memory tier optimized for its specific purpose and access patterns

✅ **July 06, 2025 - CRITICAL SECURITY FIX: User Data Isolation Vulnerability**
